Laravel Cachebuster
===================

Adds MD5 hashes to the URLs of your application's assets, so when they change, their URL changes. URLs contained in your
css files are transformed automatically; other URLs (such as those referenced via `<script>`, `<link>` and `<img>` tags)
are easy to transform too via a helper function in your blade templates.

Also supports adding a CDN proxy prefix to your asset URLs, to quickly and easily add the performance and scalability
of a transparent CDN such as [Cloudfront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) to your app.

Installation
------------
To get the version of cachebuster compatible with your version of laravel, follow the notes below regarding installation

1) Add the following to your **composer.json**

#### For Laravel 5.x
```bash
"themonkeys/cachebuster" :"2.*"
```

#### For Laravel 4.x
```bash
"themonkeys/cachebuster" :"1.*"
```


> **Note:** IFor continued Laravel 4 support, please use the cachebuster 1.x releases, and not dev-master*

2) Run `composer update`

3) Once cachebuster is installed you need to register the service provider with the application.
Open up `app/config/app.php` and find the `providers` key.

```php
'providers' => array(
    'Themonkeys\Cachebuster\CachebusterServiceProvider',
)
```

4) The package ships with a facade which provides a concise static syntax for encoding your URLs. You can register the
facade via the `aliases` key of your `app/config/app.php` file.

```php
'aliases' => array(
    'Bust' => 'Themonkeys\Cachebuster\Cachebuster'
)
```

5) Add the following to your .htaccess file **before** the Laravel rewrite rule:

```ApacheConf
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | Remove cachebuster hash from request URLs if present                       |
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteRule ^(.*)-[0-9a-f]{32}(\.(.*))$ $1$2 [DPI]
</IfModule>
```

> **Note:** If you're using NGINX and not interpreting `.htaccess` files, see 
  [this gist](https://gist.github.com/RTC1/89d7f95555be8cf7d1aa) by @RTC1 for the equivalent NGINX rewrite rule.

And add the following to your .htaccess file **after** the Laravel rewrite rule:

```ApacheConf
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | Allow Laravel to pre-process the css to add cachebusters to image urls     |
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/index.php
    RewriteRule ^(.*\.css)$ index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

6) Finally, add this to your `app/routes.php` file:

```php
Route::get('{path}', function($filename) {
  return Bust::css($filename);
})->where('path', '.*\.css$');
App::make('cachebuster.StripSessionCookiesFilter')->addPattern('|\.css$|');
```

> Note: this wildcard route is known to conflict with the wildcard route used by [croppa](https://github.com/BKWLD/croppa),
> rendering Croppa ineffective. Should that affect you, simply be more specific with the CSS route. For example, if all 
> your css files are in a `css/` folder:
> 
> ```
> Route::get('/css/{path}', function($filename) {
>     return Bust::css("/css/$filename");
> })->where('path', '.*\.css$');
> ```
> Or you could even use `Bust::css()` within a filter instead.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the package, you can use the following command which wil publish the configuration file(s) to `app/config/`.

#### Laravel 5.x
```sh
php artisan vendor:publish
```
Will publish to: `/app/config/cachebuster.php`. 

The settings themselves are documented inside `/app/config/cachebuster.php`. You can change the default settings here too, for when the environment variables are not detected.

> **Note:** Laravel 5.x [changed envronment configuration to use dotEnv files](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/configuration#environment-configuration "Laravel 5"), and you will need to "enable" cachebuster using the dotEnv paradigm for each environment your application requires.

For example, to enable cachebuster, open up your `.env` file, and add the following line 

```bash
CACHEBUSTER_ENABLED = true
```


#### Laravel 4.x
```sh
php artisan config:publish themonkeys/cachebuster
```
Will publish to: `app/config/packages/themonkeys/cachebuster`.

Or you can just create a new file in that folder and only override the settings you need. The settings themselves are documented inside `app/config/packages/themonkeys/cachebuster/config.php`.


Using Laravel's built-in development server
-------------------------------------------

You may want to use Laravel's built-in development server to serve your application, for example for automated testing.
Since that server doesn't support the necessary URL rewriting, the simplest solution is to disable cachebusting for that
environment. Do that by creating the file `app/config/packages/themonkeys/cachebuster/testing/config.php` (replace
`testing` with the environment used by the development server) with the contents:

    <?php
    return array(
        'enabled' => false,
    );

If, instead, you still want to enable cachebusting under the development server, you can use the code in [this gist]
(https://gist.github.com/felthy/3fc1675a6a89db891396). Thanks to [RTC1](https://github.com/RTC1) for the original code
upon which that gist is based.


Usage
-----

Wherever you specify an asset path in your blade templates, use `Bust::url()` to transform the path. For example, a
script tag like this...

```HTML
<script src="{{ Bust::url('/js/main.js') }}"></script>
```

...will look like this to your users:

```HTML
<script src="/js/main-a09b64644df96f807a0db134d27912bf.js"></script>
```

Or if you've configured a CDN it might look like:

```HTML
<script src="//a1bc23de4fgh5i.cloudfront.net/js/main-a09b64644df96f807a0db134d27912bf.js"></script>
```

The same goes for `<img>` tags:

```HTML
<img src="{{ Bust::url('/img/spacer.gif') }}" alt="">
```

will look like this to your users:

```HTML
<img src="/img/spacer-5e416a75e3af86e42b1a3bc8efc33ebc.gif" alt="">
```

The final piece of the puzzle is your css:

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ Bust::url('/css/main.css') }}">
```

comes out looking like this:

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main-f75168d5f53c7a09d9a08840d7b5a5ec.css">
```

Some real magic happens here - all the URLs inside your CSS file (images, fonts etc.) are automatically passed through
the cachebuster, so they now have hashes in their filenames too. Open the CSS file in your browser and have a look!

### Absolute URLs

Sometimes you might want to specify an absolute URL, for example in an OpenGraph meta tag. That's easy:

```HTML
<meta property="og:image" content="{{ Bust::url('/img/share-thumbnail.jpg', true) }}" />
```

might come out as:

```HTML
<meta property="og:image" content="http://yourhost/img/share-thumbnail-2a7d7b5a4401ef3176565dffcd59b282.png" />
```

This uses Laravel's built-in URL generators so the URLs will be generated depending on your environment.
